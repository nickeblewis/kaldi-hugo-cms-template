# HeadForCode

We would like to offer our services to the members of the [Farnborough Jets BNI Chapter](http://www.bnihampshire.com/farnborough-jets/) and thank you for taking the time to visit this website. We develop our expertise in building applications for businesses just like yours. We thought it would be a good idea to highlight just some of the things we do and can offer you. We hope you find something here of interest and look forward to chatting with you in the future.

## Where are we?

We are based in Farnborough at the former Town Hall, Ferneberga House, right next door to the Alexandra Road Post Office depot. You are welcome to come and see us but it's often best to pop us an email first to make sure we are about and aslo so that we can get biscuits. What kind of meeting would it be without those!

## What we do?

We could just say that we build web and mobile apps, whilst that is a little bit vague in many ways, it is what we do! 

* We take on a lot of contract work which means we often work with big companies for a few months at a time, sometimes on site and from our own premises in Farnborough. Right now we are working with Premium Credit Ltd on a project that enables insurance brokers to process their customers' premiums
* We have in the past worked with The AA, Transport for London, Zurich Insurance, Save the Children and others
* We are currently developing a product called Farnborough Guide which is going to be a platform for helping businesses promote themselves to local people. It will be more in depth about the topics it covers compared to other sites

## Who are we?

There are three of us, we are small and proud of being so. Two Directors, one of whom is myself, Nick Lewis and I play a kind of CEO/CTO role. Tina Lewis (my Wife) who takes care of the HR side of things and is also currently engaged in a long term contract. Dan Davis who is our newest member of the team. He helps us build web apps and provides a very dry sense of humour to the mix.... In fact we are all pretty daft when it comes down to it!

## Why come to us?

We have a "can do" attitude but at the same time would also be honest if we feel a project is beyong our scope.

## What are we looking for right now?

So here is the call to action for you as it were. We are busy right now which is great but in the Spring time this year we are going to have some capacity as they say in the business. We will be able to take new work on around then and we are prompting people to get in touch now with their needs.

### What would be our ideal project

Well we are working on one or two off our own backs and they are coming along well but we would love to build some business focussed web apps for people. Totally bespoke products that we can continue to support for you for many years. We are looking at not just developing new applications but also at building new B2B relationships around the area.
