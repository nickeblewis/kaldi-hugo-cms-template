        We are working more frequently with other Developers, ranging from apprentices, through to highly experienced professionals. Most of these people face the same daily challenges as we do. Mentoring is a great way of helping people learn based on our own knowledge and experiences. In return we often learn quite a lot from the people we teach.

  heading: Re-inventing the CMS
  description: >
    People for many years have been building their content rich sites using 
    Wordpress and Drupal. In fact we used to build sites that way too, that was before we discovered the new way of doing it. The JAMStack is a whole new way of building sites where multiple people can add and edit content. It is more secure and faster to deploy updates to the web. No servers as such, just fast content distributed via CDN.
