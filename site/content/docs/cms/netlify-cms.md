## Best of both worlds

* The workflow for this site is dependent on GitHub, as is NetlifyCMS
* So you can edit content with VSC or using the Netlify CMS web interface

## Who will use this?

* We can use it for writing content especially when we want to write draft articles
* When we use this sytem for other projects such as Carpnado our clients can use the web admin, they will find it easy enough to understand and use

## Notes on how workflow works
