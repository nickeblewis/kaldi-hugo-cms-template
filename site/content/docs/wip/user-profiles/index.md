Let's use this page as our index for resources on user profiles and other ideas that we have to help complete the college module.

## User management for HeadForCode

Dan, I shall demonstrate how this works to you but here are some quick notes to start the conversation, please use the Disqus bit at the bottom to ask questions about this.

### Netlify CMS

Before reading any further, may I point you in the direction of some great resources for this CMS system:

* Link 1
* Link 2

In a nutshell I can add you as a "collaborator" within GitHub, which in turn becomes our back-end of sorts. This will send you an email. If you were completely new to Github it would get you to register.

You then go to http://www.headforcode.com/admin and you will see in the middle of the screen a button, click on that button and login to use the CMS back-end. You probably won't need to sign in next time, it will remember who you are.


## New User Profile feature for Farnborough Guide

To be discussed

## Auth0 and GraphCool

This is a little bit complex and could do with a series of screencasts to explain it all in a decent way but for now because I am unable to record video here, here are some notes that can later be used to put together a more solid course on how to do this.

We shall run through the steps of creating registration and login pages, where not only can we create a user account with password, we can control such things as privileges and roles for each user. So let's go into a bit more detail of what those two things mean and what the distinction is between them.

### Privileges

What are they?

### Roles

What are they?
