title: Hugo and us

We have switched to using Hugo from Phenomic, still hosting on Netlify and we have added their new app called Netlify CMS which is very clever and warrants an entire article or screencast of it's own. It is simple but very powerful. I mean that this way of building sites has up until now been very techie, not at all good for people who are not of a technical mindset, such as Rolf, however I think this setup will actually be a lot nicer to use, even when compared to Wordpress.

In any case, I need to had this over to you, so that you can learn it and pretty much take over on the running of future sites, such as Carpnado. Incidentally we plan to catch up with them in May.
