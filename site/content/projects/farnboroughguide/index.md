## Events

How do we represent these bearing in mind we have

* The Umbraco site
* The upcoming GraphQL React site
* The mobile app

We have a need right now to promote the event that ken sent over and in future we need a way of:

* Quickly adding such events
* Instantly broadcasting these via our Twitter and Facebook accounts, we should use a Webtask or StdLib for that if we can, so as soon as the event is added.... zoom post it out to social media
