# Lesson 3 - Creating a "Pull Request"

The last lesson was quite a big one, this is a bit smaller. In the last lesson, you learnt how to create a branch, make a minor change, commit that change and push it up.

Now supposing this was a bigger piece of work and that you were not just changing a piece of text in a README.md file, we would need to review eachothers work, yes, you will get to review mine too, it is a two way process. 
We will always review code changes before applying them to the Master branch because in doing so, we are releasing changes to the live site. This process is more a way of checking that what is changing 
is not going to break anything that is currently running ok. A sanity check but we also can treat this as a great way of training you at this point in time.

So code reviews are something we shall be doing a lot of in the months to come.

Here are two screencasts, the first is about Pull Requests (or PR for short) and the second is something of a bonus video that discusses another way of interacting with Git branches, commits and pushes using nothing but Visual Studio Code. In fact we shall later spend time looking at what we can do with VSC, as it can be configured to do most things for us and as a result - speed up and simplify our workflow even more! Watch this space as they say!!
