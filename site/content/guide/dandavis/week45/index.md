## What's the plan for this week?

- First of all ensure that you have caught up with Vinay and that unit 101 is up-to-date and take all the time you need to get the next module underway, complete it early if you can and keep in touch with Vinay for his feedback
- We shall also focus on building Farnborough Guide using the same approach as I have for this website, headforcode and I shall teach you how from a very practical point of view
    - This means that I will firstly need to set up a new Github project that you can clone.... will update this page when that has been done

## Once the Farnborough Guide ReactJS version has been created...

We shall then build a site that takes elements of the one you've been building in Umbraco and ideas from the Hyde Park site that you've seen, giving it a Christmas overlay that we can easily switch on or off at this time of the year. The new site will start by focussing on events coming up over Christmas, New Year and the beginning of 2017. 

I am not sure how long it will take and I will leave a lot up to you on this to be honest, as I have very little time but do have enough time to give you some ideas.

We can probably at least add falling background snow on the site, that would be good enough.

## Skills taught

TODO - I need to look at which units this project will cover, probably not all of them but then we have plenty of time in 2017 to pick up on those.
