Hi Dan, I am just preparing some things for us to begin looking at, as an exercise for you to begin learning some real code and at the same time for me to re-learn some skills I've ot worked with for a year or so.... shall be fun

First of all a little history lesson on how I started out in Web development. One of the first things I learnt was how to develop applications using what was at the time called ASP

(now known as Classic ASP, as it is seldom used now)

ASP was based on Visual Basic but later came C# as part of the new .NET framework and ASP.NET

This framework is still going strong and they have just revamped it and have launched ASP.NET Core 1.0 and you can learn more about it at the following address

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/

Have a look at this, some of it is a bit brief and may lead you to asking more questions but that is totally, fine, as I will help you along

A really good tutorial to start with is the article:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc

Don't underestimate .NET, it is colossal but you don't need to learn it all to get started.

I would for now just start with the above link, let me know once you've got that working and we can move onto the other parts

Before going too deep, it will be a great idea to learn more about C# itself, the language at the heart of C#. In fact there are two other languages you could use but C# is by far the most commonly used, so makes sense to begin with that.

We will use these new skills to move on to learning loads more about the Microsoft eco-system and build some apps

Whats more Umbraco is built with ASP.NET and C#, though not the Core version but I do know the Umbraco team will be building their next version with it....

I shall paste all of the above into a page on the headforcode site, so that we can share this stuff with Vinay too
