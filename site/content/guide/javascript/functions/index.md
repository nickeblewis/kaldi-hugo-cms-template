JavaScript is an interesting place right now due to the changes taking place within the 
language itself, but it will be easier to start off talking about the slightly older way of doing 
things before we move on to the "cutting edge".

Functions are an integral part of JavaScript and it would be next to useless without them, so it is important to build an 
understanding of what they are and how they work.

## Introduction

JavaScript functions are __defined__ with the __function__ keyword.

You can use a function __declaration__ or a function __expression__.

All of these things will become clearer as we discuss examples... I shall treat this article as one that will 
evolve over time, so please feel free to discuss usin the comments feature below! I am keen for it to be used so go for it! Go on! ;-)

## Function Declarations

You can __declare__ a function using the following syntax:

``` JavaScript
function addTogether(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

In the above example you would be expecting two values to be passed in

## Function Expressions
