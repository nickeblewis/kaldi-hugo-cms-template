## Unit summary

Health and Safety in ICT
101 Y/500/7183 1

This unit explores compliance with health and safety legislation when working in ICT.
The basis of health and safety law is the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. The Act sets out the general duties which employers have towards employees and members of the public, and employees have to themselves and to each other.
What the law requires here is what good management and common sense would lead individuals and organisations to do anyway: that is, identify risks and take sensible measures to tackle them.
Health and safety legislation impacts not only on those who are employed at work, but on visitors, bystanders and customers who may be affected by actions of those engaged in work activities.
Health and safety legislation is subject to constant review, and new legislation is introduced on a regular basis. This constant change must be monitored by organisations and individuals to identify actions required to remain compliant. Interpretation of the legislation may also be modified as a result of case law or other legal guidance.

## Assessment methodology
