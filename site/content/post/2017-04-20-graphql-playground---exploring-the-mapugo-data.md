We shall introduce Mapugo properly at some point soon, but all that you need to know for now is that it is a crowd-sourced location finding app, a slight mouthful but that is essentially what it is. It is powered by a very awesome SaaS (in fact it could also be referred to as a GaaS, BaaS just to confuse you all) called [GraphCool ](https://graph.cool)and we are going to run a series of articles about this from today.
