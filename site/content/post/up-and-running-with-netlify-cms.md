We kicked this project off using the [Victor Hugo](https://github.com/netlify-templates/kaldi-hugo-cms-template) template which includes ready made integrations for the [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and you can click on a magical deploy button that created the [guard-sylvia-57580.netlify.com](http://guard-sylvia-57580.netlify.com) instance for us on [Netlify](http://netlify.com). We started to develop this new site from there and began to learn more about how Hugo works. The whole process was quite amazing and magical!

## Using the CMS admin for the first time

In order to use the Netlify CMS you simply need to add "/admin" onto the end of your main URL and then you'll be prompted to authenticate with Github. You will of course need a Github account and the likelihood is that you will already have one. However you do need to authenticate the new site with Github first. To learn how to do this, we added a new application via:

[https://github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers)

Then you will be able to login using Github as your authentication provider.
